Week2 day 2 notes

state = object that holds info that may change overtime of the component
    changing state triggers a "re-render" to update that specific part the component that requires updating 
    refreshing wipes state clean
    state can be acceseed using useState "hook" when writing functional components.

Hooks = a special function built to allow us to accesses default react functionality
    Hooks need to be included with react in our import
        
UseState = has getter( this is used to GET the value of the state) and a Setter(USed to SET or CHANGE the value of the sate)
  
Sythetic Events Working with state


Event Object (E)
    built in both JS and React to allow us to accesses attributes of the current event object. This is used in conjuction with outr Synthetic Events.
    Three commonly used eventListeners in React
        onclick
        ocChange
        onSubmit

State in child component is not accessible by others only the child?
